zkndb is a simple storage benchmarking application. It was created with the purpose of benchmarking the specific implementations of Storage from Apache's YARN although it is general enough to benchmark any common storage system. So far it has implementations for HDFS, Zookeeper and NDB MySQL. It is composed by 3 packages: benchmark, metrics and storage.
