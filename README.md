zkndb is a storage benchmarking framework. Although it was created with the purpose of benchmarking the specific implementations of Storage from Apache's YARN, it is general enough to benchmark any common storage system with minimum effort. So far it has implementations for HDFS, Zookeeper and NDB MySQL. It is composed by 3 packages: benchmark, metrics and storage.
